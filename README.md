Hey! :)

Today I was browsing YouTube and came across this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQBY9BM9g_Y

Where the guy explains a very old technique from my teenage years, using games like Comanche Overkill!

The guy explains how to replicate this very old effect! In the links to his video, he also provides links to the
original Comanche Overkill maps! Try them with my code! :)

So I worked on a super fast blitz3D version! I had to cut back on the Z precision to get more FPS, but the result
with the game maps is really nice!
